### 3. Brief Introduction

* VeriMint is a zero-knowledge-based decentralized application for NFT ownership and digital property rights confirmation and certification.

  **Current application scenarios:**

  * Personal IP creation: Support the originality of personal IP, and support the legal joining of other creators; form a community or DAO based on recognition of the value in NFT. Organizational cohesion is not just the recognition of an NFT, but an equal Can participate in creation; provide a way for personal IP to break the monopoly development of large company IP;

  * Luxury goods infringement protection: Provide luxury goods manufacturers with a simple anti-piracy verification method, which can encourage more creators to design in a legal way and support the dual development of manufacturers and individuals.

  **Vision:**

  * Support NFT form innovation: such as generating dynamic NFT based on the chain of ownership changes; supporting the rapid development of digital physical goods and introducing NFT into the off-chain market

  * Form NFT infrastructure: provide a solution for digital copyright protection, and create value based on the protection of original rights and ownership

  **Direct Contribution:**

  * NFT rights confirmation and certification: Make sure you get an NFT with the creator’s value embedded in it (such as IP, brand use authorization)
  * Copyright protection: Provide protection measures for creators’ value
  * Incentivize value creation: Creators focus more on creation itself, promoting high-quality, multi-form NFT creation
